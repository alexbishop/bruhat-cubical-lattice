# Type D Bruhat graphs

**Notice:** this code has errors which will be corrected in the coming hours.

This repository contains a SageMath script which generates the bruhat graph for Coxeter groups, and attempts to find spanning cubical lattices.

For example, you can run this script for type D5 as follows.

```bash
sage generate-matching.sage D 5
```

## Requirements

In order to run this script, you will require the following.

 - SageMath
 - [Coxeter](http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~ducloux/coxeter/coxeter3/english/coxeter3_e.html) by Fokko du Cloux
 - `coxeter3-sage` (see [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/coxeter3-sage/))
